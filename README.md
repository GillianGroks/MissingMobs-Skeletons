I always found it kind of odd that sentient mobs didn't have a skeleton model in the game. Villagers, Illagers, and Piglins should all have skeletons too!

Also, where do they keep pulling those arrows from?

While there are other resource packs out there that add a ton of other mob variants, I wanted a pack that still kept the feel of vanilla, while adding a little variety.

Piglin variants will only spawn in the Nether, as that is their native dimension. Normal and Villager variants will only spawn in the overworld.

This pack adds:

    quivers to skeletons and strays
    villager skeletons that spawn less frequently the lower you are below the surface
    piglin skeletons that replace skeletons in the nether
    villager strays
    piglin nether skeletons
